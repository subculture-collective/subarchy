# delivers into root's staging folder reach the user's Downloads through
# setpriv as that user, under free names (a taken name gets -1), and each
# is announced (a link to nowhere, a folder or a link to a folder also
# takes a name, and a long name is shortened to fit its number; a file that
# cannot be saved is announced as such); a finished get an earlier run left
# is delivered first, and of an unfinished one the files it logged as
# written arrive while a cut-off file is dropped unannounced; a failed get
# delivers the files it finished; a removed Downloads is made again; a
# refusal (signed out) fails --once.
#
# Send (`subcult tailscale send`): each picked file goes to the root helper
# through pkexec as standard input, with its name and the machine's
# address; a name is looked up first; --name names the machine in the
# picker and the notification; a closed picker sends nothing; a failed
# transfer is announced and fails.
