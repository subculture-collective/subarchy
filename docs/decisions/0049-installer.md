# ADR 0049: Installer and install image

Decision map item R2. Accepted 2026-11-06.

## Decision

- A **Subarchy live ISO**, built with **archiso** in CI.
- A **terminal (TUI) installer** on the ISO: keyboard, disk, LUKS passphrase,
  user, hostname and time zone, then the scripted install of everything the
  decisions above define.
- The ISO carries a **package cache** for the base and default apps, so an
  install works offline; with network it can fetch newer packages from the
  stable channel.

## Options considered

| Option | Why not chosen |
|---|---|
| Arch ISO plus an install script | First boot looks like Arch, and it needs network. |
| Calamares graphical installer | Heavy to build and theme; the disk, LUKS and btrfs choices must be encoded in its modules. |

## Borrowed from Omarchy

- `omacom/omarchy-iso` (MIT, active on 2026-11-06): the ISO builder and its
  offline mirror built from the package lists.
- `install/provisioning/setup-form.sh`: the questions asked and the rules
  their answers are checked against, shared by the ISO and first-boot setup.
- `install/` scripts for the post-partition steps.

## Consequences

- The installer creates the layout from [[0009-disk-layout|ADR 0009]],
  encryption from [[0010-disk-encryption|ADR 0010]], the systemd UKIs from
  [[0008-initramfs|ADR 0008]], Limine from [[0007-bootloader|ADR 0007]] and
  the snapper config from [[0011-snapshots|ADR 0011]].
- Hardware detection ([[0005-firmware|ADR 0005]],
  [[0006-gpu-drivers|ADR 0006]], [[0050-hardware-support|ADR 0050]]) runs in
  the installer.
- The CI boot test ([[0026-update-model|ADR 0026]]) uses the same ISO in a
  VM.
- The installer asks which disk to use and leaves every other disk untouched.
  On a machine with another OS on a second disk it creates its own EFI
  partition on the target disk, adds its own firmware boot entry, and can
  add a Limine entry that chainloads the other disk's bootloader.
  The first install is `sputnik`'s empty second drive: `nvme0n1`, a 931.5 GB
  SPCC SSD with a blank GPT and no partitions (2026-11-07). Omarchy stays on
  `nvme1n1` (Crucial P5) as the fallback; its Limine firmware entry is
  `Boot0002`.
- The installer takes an `@factory` btrfs snapshot of the finished install,
  kept outside snapper's rotation, and supports a first-boot owner setup, so
  factory reset works ([[0056-quality-of-life|ADR 0056]]). Borrowed from
  Omarchy's `omarchy-system-factory-reset` and
  `install/provisioning/` (owner setup, LUKS re-key).
- ISO size grows with the full default app set
  ([[0044-default-apps|ADR 0044]]).

## Progress

- 2026-11-07: the live ISO builds with archiso (`make iso`) and boots in QEMU
  (`make iso-test`). The scripted installer `install/subarchy-install`
  installs the base system into a VM disk: LUKS2, btrfs subvolumes, UKIs for
  both kernels, Limine, snapper, zram and NetworkManager. The disk boots,
  takes the passphrase on the serial console and reaches `running`
  (`make install-test`). Still to come: the TUI, snapshot boot entries,
  Plymouth, the desktop and the offline package cache.
- 2026-11-07, later: snapshot entries, Plymouth and the desktop session
  landed. `subarchy-setup` asks the questions with plain line prompts instead
  of a full-screen TUI, so it works on any console including serial; the VM
  test drives it end to end with `--guided`. The image carries Subarchy's own
  packages in `/opt/subarchy/repo`; Arch packages still come from the
  network, so the offline cache is still open.
- 2026-11-08: the offline cache (issue #77). `make iso` downloads the whole
  install set, the install lists plus every hardware package `subcult hw
  packages --all` can pick, with dependencies, into the same repository the
  image carries at `/opt/subarchy/repo`. The installer probes one Arch
  mirror: reachable, the mirrors come first in its pacman.conf so newer
  packages win and the image's repository serves as a package cache;
  unreachable (or `OFFLINE=1`), the repository alone serves the install.
  `make install-test-offline` runs the guided install in a VM with no
  network device.
- 2026-11-11: first step towards Omarchy's installer flow (issue #124). The
  installer starts by itself on the first console, shows the partitions on
  each disk and can open one read-only, uses the password as the disk
  passphrase unless asked otherwise, confirms with yes/no, and ends with
  the install time and a reboot offer or, on failure, a menu. Still plain
  line prompts, so the serial console keeps working.
- 2026-11-11, later: on a virtual console the questions are full screens
  drawn with `gum` (greeter, pick lists, summary table, Escape to go back),
  with the SUBCULT palette and a Terminus console font. Serial consoles
  keep the line prompts. The VM install test now installs through the
  screens: keys go in through QMP and the console text is read from
  `/dev/vcs`. While the install runs, a bar with a percentage, the phase
  and a rotating tip replace the raw output, which stays in the log. A
  language screen sets the installed system's locale; the installer's own
  text stays English.
- 2026-11-12: after the first install on real hardware. The bar names
  pacman's checks before the first package unpacks, and counts pacman's
  hooks after the last one ("Setting up packages (n of m)"), where the
  DKMS modules and kernel images are built; the configuring phase starts
  at 90%. The log window drops terminal escape sequences and marks a cut
  line with an ellipsis. The time zone and computer name come under the
  machine heading, the time zone list holds tzdata's zone.tab and
  zone1970.tab names (no US/Central-style aliases) and matches typed text
  as a substring, and the summary shows each secret as "set (hidden)".
  Before a reboot or power-off the installer restores the console's
  palette and lowers the kernel's console log level.
- 2026-11-12: before the read-only browse opens, a page lists the
  partitions it opened, the ones it left closed and why, and how to come
  back: q, or Esc then 0, since F10 is a media key on many laptops. `mc`
  opens both panels on the disk and runs with no subshell and no command
  line, and the disk is mounted `noexec`, so typed text and Return on a
  file do not run anything. Its pull-down menus can still run a command
  typed into their dialogs.
- 2026-11-12: a network page (review finding network-possibly-down: the
  first install, on a laptop with no Ethernet port, came up offline
  because the installer had no network step). With no link up and a Wi-Fi
  device in iwd, the page after the keyboard lists the Wi-Fi networks,
  joins one with a passphrase typed as a hidden input, or skips to an
  offline install. The Wi-Fi network the live session is on when the
  questions end, joined there or by hand with `iwctl`, becomes a
  NetworkManager connection on the installed system
  ([[0016-networking|ADR 0016]]), so the first boot is online. The
  passphrase reaches `subarchy-install` in a mode-600 file, as the
  other secrets do, and is never shown or logged. The VM test can only
  check that a VM without Wi-Fi skips the page; joining a real network is
  untested on hardware.
