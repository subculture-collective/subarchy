"""Every app the catalogue marks `preinstalled = true` (default/apps.toml,
ADR 0044) must be installed by a new system: each of its packages is named
in an install list (install/packages/*.txt), which the installer and the ISO
build read. AUR apps not yet rebuilt in Subarchy's repository are listed in
PENDING; the check fails when that list is out of date in either direction,
so it cannot grow unnoticed."""
