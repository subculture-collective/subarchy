# in the user's ~/Downloads (a taken name gets -1, -2 ...) and each is
# announced. tailscaled hands Taildrop files only to root or its operator,
# and Subarchy makes no one the operator (ADR 0062), so the receiving side

# Root keeps the files in its own folder, $STATE_DIRECTORY (systemd's
# StateDirectory, mode 0700), and never writes in the user's home: each file
# goes over as standard input to --deliver, run as the user with setpriv,
# so a link the user planted in their home cannot point root's writes
