# Open questions

Answer inline and move answered items to the bottom with the date.

## Identity

1. Is "Subcarchy" the public name, or a working title? See
   [[brand-identity|brand identity]] for the clash checks.
2. Who is the publisher: Patrick Fanella personally or the
   `subculture-collective` organisation?
3. Should `os-release` keep `ID_LIKE` including `omarchy` for compatibility?

## Licence and assets

4. Which licence for Subcarchy's own code? MIT matches Omarchy and the rice.
5. Can the SUBCULT marks and the Oswald and JetBrains Mono fonts be
   redistributed in an image under the rice's `ASSETS_LICENSE.md` terms?
6. Which community plugins and themes allow redistribution? Not yet checked.

## Hosting and build

7. Where does the canonical repository live? `git.subcult.tv` (matching the
   rice) is the default. This repository has no remote yet.
8. Where is the Subcarchy pacman repository hosted, and who holds the signing
   key?
9. Is this repository the Omarchy fork itself, or a separate build repository?
   (ADR 0001 open question.)
10. Track upstream `main` or releases only, and how often to merge?

## Scope

11. Which machines are targets? `sputnik` (x86_64 laptop with dock) is the
    reference. Omarchy also supports aarch64 (Apple Silicon, Qualcomm, NVIDIA
    GB10/N1X); supporting them multiplies testing.
12. Is the first deliverable an ISO, or a conversion of an existing Omarchy
    install?
13. Is the default user a developer like the owner, or a general user? This
    decides how many of the 179 extra packages and 63 mise tools matter.
14. Are AI agent integrations (Omarchy's `omarchy agent` commands and bar
    widget, voxtype dictation) part of the default experience?

## Housekeeping

15. The old `PatrickFanella/omarchy-subcult-theme` also installs as `subcult`.
    Retire or rename it?
16. `sputnik` has many `.bak` files in `~/.config/hypr` and
    `~/.config/omarchy`. Clean up before capturing a reference configuration?
17. The Machinum host briefing lists OmaSSH and Fleetbar plugins as installed
    on 2026-10-06; neither is in `~/.config/omarchy/plugins` now. Were they
    removed on purpose?
